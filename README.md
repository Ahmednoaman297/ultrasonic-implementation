# Distance Measurement System Using HC-SR04 and ATmega32

## Overview

This project implements a distance measurement system using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and displays the measured distance on a 4x16 LCD. The ATmega32 microcontroller is used with an 8MHz clock frequency. The implementation follows a layered architecture model with drivers for GPIO, ICU, LCD, and the ultrasonic sensor.

## Components Used

- **Microcontroller**: ATmega32 running at 8MHz.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: HC-SR04.
- **LCD**: 4x16 character display.
- **Additional Components**: Resistors, capacitors, and connecting wires.
